vars-global version 0.0.1

This module lets you define 'global' variables and gain a slight
advantage over blind use of package variables.

SYNOPSIS

    # In the place/package where we want to create globals
    use vars::global create => qw( $foo @bar %baz );

    # Add some more global symbols
    vars::global->create(qw( $hello @world %now ));

    # Somewhere else, where we need to access those globals
    use vars::global qw( $foo @bar %baz );

    # Don't try to use globals that do not exist
    use vars::global qw( $Foo ); # typo, croaks
    use vars::global qw( @inexistent ); # we don't create by default
                                        # use 'create' as above

    # You can also import and create new globals
    use vars::global qw( $foo %baz ), create => qw( $hey @joe );

    # If you're lazy, you can import all the globals defined so far
    use vars::global ':all';
